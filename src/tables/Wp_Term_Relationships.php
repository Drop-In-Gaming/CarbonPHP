    /**
     * PHP validations works as follows:
     * @note regex validation is always step #1 and should be favored over php validations.
     *  Syntax ::
     *      [Example_Class::class => 'disallowPublicAccess', (optional) ...$rest]
     *      self::EXAMPLE_COLUMN => [Example_Class::class => 'exampleOtherMethod', (optional) ...$rest]
     *
     *  Callables defined above MUST NOT RETURN FALSE. Moreover; return values are ignored so `): void {` may be used. 
     *  array_key_first() must return a classes fully qualified class with namespace. In the example above Example_Class would be a 
     *  class defined in our system. PHP's `::class` appended to the end will return the fully qualified namespace. Note
     *  this will require the custom import added to the top of the file. You can allow your editor to add these for you
     *  as the RestBuilder program will capture, preserve, and possibly reorder the imports. The value of the first key 
     *  MUST BE the exact name of a member-method of that class. Typically validations are defined in the same class 
     *  they are used ('self::class') though it is useful to export more dynamic functions. The $rest variable can be 
     *  used to add additional arguments to the request. RESTFUL INTERNAL ARGUMENTS will be passed before any use defined
     *  variables after the first key value pair. Only array values will be passed to the method. Thus, additional keys 
     *  listed in the array will be ignored. Take for example::
     *
     *      [ self::class => 'validateUnique', self::class, self::EXAMPLE_COLUMN]
     *  The above is defined in RestfulValidations::class. 
     *      RestfulValidations::validateUnique(string $columnValue, string $className, string $columnName)
     *  Its definition is with a trait this classes inherits using `use` just after the `class` keyword. 
     * 
     *   What is the RESTFUL lifecycle?
     *      Regex validations are done first on any main query; sub-queries are treated like callbacks which get run 
     *      during the main queries invocation. The main query is 'paused' while the sub-query will compile and validate.
     *      Validations across tables are concatenated on joins and sub-queries. All callbacks will be run across any 
     *       table joins.
     *      
     *   What are the RESTFUL INTERNAL ARGUMENTS? (The single $arg string or array passed before my own...)
     *      REST_REQUEST_PREPROCESS_CALLBACKS ::   
     *           PREPROCESS::
     *              Methods defined here will be called at the beginning of every request. 
     *              Each method will be passed ( & self::$REST_REQUEST_PARAMETERS ) by reference so changes can be made pre-request.
     *              Method validations under the main 'PREPROCESS' key will be run first, while validations specific to 
     *              ( GET | POST | PUT | DELETE )::PREPROCESS will be run directly after.
     *
     *           FINAL:: 
     *              Each method will be passed the final ( & $SQL ), which may be a sub-query, by reference.
     *              Modifying the SQL string will effect the parent function. This can have disastrous effects.
     *
     *           COLUMN::
     *              Preformed while a column is being parsed in a query. The first column validations to run.
     *              Each column specific method under PREPROCESS will be passed nothing from rest. 
     *              Each method will ONLY be RUN ONCE regardless of how many times the column has been seen. 
     *
     *      COLUMN::
     *           Column validations are only run when they have been parsed in the query. Global column validations maybe
     *            RUN MULTIPLE TIMES if the column is used multiple times in a single restful query. 
     *           If you have a column that is used multiple times the validations will run for each occurrence.
     *           Column validation can mean many thing. There are three possible scenarios in which your method 
     *            signature would change. For this reason it is more common to use method ( GET | POST ... ) wise column validations.
     *              *The signature required are as follows:
     *                  Should the column be...
     *                      SELECTED:  
     *                          In a select stmt no additional parameters will be passed.
     *                      
     *                      ORDERED BY: (self::ASC | self::DESC)
     *                          The $operator will be passed to the method.
     *  
     *                      JOIN STMT:
     *                          The $operator followed by the $value will be passed. 
     *                          The operator could be :: >,<,<=,<,=,<>,=,<=>
     *
     *      REST_REQUEST_FINNISH_CALLBACKS::
     *          PREPROCESS::
     *              These callbacks are called after a successful PDOStatement->execute() but before Database::commit().
     *              Each method will be passed ( GET => &$return, DELETE => &$remove, PUT => &$returnUpdated ) by reference. 
     *              POST will BE PASSED NULL.          
     *
     *          FINAL::
     *              Run directly after method specific [FINAL] callbacks.
     *              The final, 'final' callback set. After these run rest will return. 
     *              Each method will be passed ( GET => &$return, DELETE => &$remove, PUT => &$returnUpdated ) by reference. 
     *              POST will BE PASSED NULL. 
     *
     *          COLUMN::
     *              These callables will be run after the [( GET | POST | PUT | DELETE )][FINAL] methods.
     *              Directly after, the [REST_REQUEST_FINNISH_CALLBACKS][FINAL] will run. 
     *              
     *
     *      (POST|GET|PUT|DELETE)::
     *          PREPROCESS::
     *              Methods run after any root 'REST_REQUEST_PREPROCESS_CALLBACKS'
     *              Each method will not be passed any argument from system. User arguments will be directly reflected.
     *
     *          COLUMN::
     *              Methods run after any root column validations, the last of the PREPROCESS column validations to run.
     *              Based on the existences and number of primary key(s), the signature will change. 
     *               See the notes on the base column validations as signature of parameters may change. 
     *              It is not possible to directly define a method->column specific post processes. This can be done by
     *               dynamically pairing multiple method processes starting with one here which signals a code routine 
     *               in a `finial`-ly defined method. The FINAL block specific to the method would suffice. 
     *
     *          FINAL::
     *              Passed the ( & $return )  
     *              Run before any other column validation 
     *
     *  Be aware the const: self::DISALLOW_PUBLIC_ACCESS = [self::class => 'disallowPublicAccess'];
     *  could be used to replace each occurrence of 
     *          [self::class => 'disallowPublicAccess', self::class]
     *  though would loose information as self::class is a dynamic variable which must be used in this class given 
     *  static and constant context.
